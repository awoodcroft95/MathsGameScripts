### About This Project
These are the C# scripts that were created for the game that I created for my final year project. This project uses the Unity game engine to create the game and uses C# scripts written in the Visual Studio development environment.
The goal of this game is to be able to teach simple Key Stage One maths to school children, as well as have the potential of being a brain training game for adults.
This uses a simple mechanic of matching two numbers to make a goal number, which is the answer to a simple equation that uses either addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
